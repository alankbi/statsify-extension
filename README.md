[Statsify](https://www.statsify.us) is a web application that allows you to view beautiful statistics and info about the web pages and websites you visit, with insights such as the following:

• Ratio of internal vs. outbound links  
• Most frequent words  
• Key phrases  
• Total word count  
• Most frequent pages  
• And more...  

Statsify is available in three formats: a website, a chrome extension, and a public API.

## Contributing 

The Statsify Chrome extension functions by loading an iframe of [https://www.statsify.us](https://www.statsify.us) with the query string `extensionMode=true`, telling the website JavaScript code to modify the UI and create a special extension view ([example](https://www.statsify.us?extensionMode=true&url=alanbi.com)). If you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit an issue or pull request in either this repo or the [Statsify website repo](https://github.com/alankbi/statsify-website).
